The application will be a simple synthesizer application.  There will be no virtual midi keyboard support because this is not a practical solution. The app should work like a synthesizer with a connected midi keyboard. So it should be usable with devices like sound cards. The aux output option seems wise for this. 

### Goals:
- [ ] Using synth via midi api.
- [ ] An easy to use synth library.
- [ ] To be able to edit the synth settings from the application.
- [ ] Output option for effectors and sound cards.
